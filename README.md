FOO-KG is a wildlife knowledge graph dataset for poaching prediction. The above figure shows its construction. 
 The Forest Observatory Ontology [FOO](https://w3id.org/def/foo#) was populated with three structured wildlife data sets generated by sensors. 
 Using [YARRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/), each data table was mapped to the sensor class, each column to property or predicate, each row to instance or individual of the class sensor, and each cell to literal.  
 The output RDF graphs are fed into the graph (i.e., triple-store) database and merged with FOO for integration and reasoning.
