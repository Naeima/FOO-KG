## Forest Observatory Ontology Knowledge Graph (FOO-KG)

1. Introduction

[FOO-KG](https://naeima.github.io/fooKG/) is a wildlife knowledge graph dataset used for poaching prediction. As shown in the figure below, it was constructed by populating the Forest Observatory Ontology [FOO](https://w3id.org/def/foo#) with three structured wildlife datasets generated by sensors. This was achieved by mapping each data table to the sensor class, each column to a property or predicate, each row to an instance or individual of the class sensor, and each cell to a literal using [YARRML](https://rml.io/yarrrml/), a human-readable text-based representation for declarative Linked Data generation rules. The output RDF graphs are then fed into a graph database and merged with FOO for integration and reasoning.

## FOO-KG for Poaching Prediction 

The figure below illustrates a framework that is a complete predictive system that combines RDF data extraction and deep learning to enable precise prediction. It includes a Keras sequential neural network for predicting the geo-location of elephants and a GNN model for predicting poaching activities using a subset of the knowledge graph. The performance of the models was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric, and accurate predictions were transformed back to their original RDF format. This integration of semantic web data and machine learning allows for more accurate and informed predictions.
